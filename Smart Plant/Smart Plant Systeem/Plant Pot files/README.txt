# Summary

Sometimes when we go away from home for a few days or are really busy the house plants (unfairly) suffer because they are not watered when they need it. This is my solution.

All the electronics, pumps and water reservoir are contained inside the pot to keep it looking smart. Each pot (if you make more than one) can also be set to the needs of different types of plants.

It has an Arduino Nano controlling everything and the cost of the components has been kept as low as possible. Below are links to the parts on Amazon.

CORRECTION: 4:05 into the video I incorrectly say to use 20cm wires to connect the water level sensor. The correct length is 35cm.
